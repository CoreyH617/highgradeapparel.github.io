                        Guccio Gucci S.p.A.,[1][2] doing business as Gucci (/
                        ˈɡuːtʃi/ ⓘ GOO-chee, Italian: [ˈɡuttʃi]), is an Italian
                        luxury fashion house based in Florence, Italy.[3][4][5]
                        Its product lines include handbags, ready-to-wear, f
                        ootwear, accessories, and home decoration; and it 
                        icenses its name and branding to Coty for fragrance 
                        and cosmetics under the name Gucci Beauty.[6]
                        Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881–1953) 
                        in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci 
                        (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, 
                        an icon of the Italian dolce vita period. Following 
                        family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was 
                        entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993.
                        After this crisis, the brand was revived and in 1999 
                        Gucci became a subsidiary of the French conglomerate 
                        PPR, which later renamed itself to Kering.
                        In 2023, Gucci operated 538 stores with 20,711 employees
                        , and generated €9.9 billion in sales.[7] Jean-François 
                        Palus has been CEO of Gucci since July 2023,[8] and 
                        Sabato De Sarno became creative director in January 
                        2023.[9][10]
