                        Andrew Saks was born to a German Jewish family, in 
                        Baltimore, Maryland. He worked as a peddler and paper 
                        boy before moving to Washington, D.C. where at the age 
                        of only 20, and in the still-chaotic and tough economic 
                        times of 1867, two years after the United States 
                        prevailed in the American Civil War, he established a 
                        men's clothing store[10] with his brother Isadore.
                        <sup>[11][12]</sup> A. Saks & Co. occupied a storefront 
                        in the Avenue House Hotel building at 517 (300–308) 7th 
                        Street, N.W., in what is still Washington's downtown 
                        shopping district. Saks offered his goods at one price 
                        only, no bargaining, and offered refunds on merchandise 
                        returns, neither of which were the more common practice 
                        at that place and time.[citation needed] Saks was also 
                        known for its "forceful and interesting, but strictly 
                        truthful" newspaper advertising, according to the 
                        Washington Evening Star, including a two-page spread, 
                        large for that time, in that newspaper on April 4, 1898.
                        
                        Saks annexed the store next door, and in 1887 started 
                        building a large new store on the site of the old 
                        Avenue Hotel Building at 7th and Market Space (now 
                        United States Navy Memorial Plaza).[13]By 1896, Saks 
                        and Co. had stores in Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; 
                        ew York City; and Indianapolis, in addition to 
                        Washington, D.C., where, Saks called itself 
                        "Washington's Wonderful Store".[14]Saks opened a very 
                        large store in 1902 in New York City's Herald Square on
                        34th Street and Broadway.<sup>[13][15]</sup>: 2  
                        Andrew Saks ran the New York store as a family affair 
                        with his brother Isadore, and his sons Horace and 
                        William.[citation needed] Andrew Saks died in 1912 and 
                        his son Horace took over the company's management.

                        In 1923, Saks & Co. merged with Gimbel Brothers, Inc., 
                        which was owned by a cousin of Horace Saks,[16] Bernard 
                        Gimbel, operating as a separate autonomous subsidiary. 
                        On September 15, 1924, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel 
                        opened in the Saks Fifth Avenue Building at 611 Fifth 
                        Avenue, with a full-block avenue frontage south of St. 
                        Patrick's Cathedral, facing what would become 
                        Rockefeller Center.[17] The architects were Starrett & 
                        van Vleck, who developed a design derived from classical
                        architecture.

                        When Bernard's cousin, Adam Gimbel, became president of 
                        Saks Fifth Avenue in 1926 after Horace Saks's sudden 
                        death, the company expanded, opening seasonal resort 
                        branches in Palm Beach (1926), Atlantic City (1927), 
                        Lincoln Road in Miami Beach (1929), Southampton on Long 
                        Island (1931), Newport, Rhode Island (1935), Sun Valley,
                        Idaho and Westbury, L.I. (1936), and Greenwich, 
                        Connecticut (1937).[18]In 1929, Saks opened its first 
                        full-line, year-round flagship store in Chicago, in 1929
                        , and only six years later moved to a larger location.
                        <sup>[18]</sup> By the end of the 1930s, Saks Fifth 
                        Avenue had a total of 10 stores – the 2 large urban 
                        flagships in New York and Chicago, and 8 resort stores.
                        During World War Two, Saks opened Navy and Army shops 
                        in New Haven, Connecticut and Princeton, New Jersey, 
                        and after the war turned the small branches into 
                        University Shops, catering to the Ivy League communities
                        there. More University Shops would open, one near 
                        Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., another in Ann Arbor, 
                        Michigan (1960).<sup>[18]</sup>

                        Saks had already opened two urban flagship stores 
                        before the U.S. joined the war: its now-legendary store 
                        in Beverly Hills, and in Detroit (1940). After the war, 
                        three more downtown stores opened, albeit smaller in 
                        scale: Pittsburgh (1949), Philadelphia (1952) and San 
                        Francisco (1952)[18] where Saks competed head-on with 
                        local luxury champion I. Magnin.<sup>[19]</sup>
